# coin_trend_chart

This program was created to make it easy to see how much money is currently flowing into the theme by organizing by themes of coins that have recently risen.
Based on approximately 2000 coins, the theme of each coin is analyzed to determine the stocks that rose the most by theme and the most coins among those stocks.

# ROAD MAP 

1. Comparison of growth rates based on up to 5 coins per coin theme

2. Start developing web pages to see themes at a glance

3. Developed to reduce overload by building an analysis backend system based on the code and storing the analysis results in the DB so that only the analyzed results can be viewed in the Spring server

First of all, sorry for replying late.
Thank you for your reply.

I have additional questions to ask.

1. What does "=" mean in RIC?
ex) Difference between LGOc1= / LGOc1

2. For LGOc1= data not collected from 2021.02.17
You said you can extract it from the Intraday report template, can you tell me more about how to set it up?
ex) Select an item from a certain menu.

3. There is no data for CHLPR1RR RIC after 2021.03.15, can it be collected if it is changed as in No. 2?
